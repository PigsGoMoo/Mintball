    <p>
      You are the lone player ball. Your task is to destroy all the other balls
      on the screen by shooting them with bullets. To move, use the keys W, A,
      S, D, and to shoot a bullet, left-click on your mouse. Things will get
      crazy as the enemy balls are not entirely benign. Some will appear with
      special abilities that will make your quest all the more challenging.
